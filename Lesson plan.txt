### Ideas ###

- Word list associated with each lesson, with translations (show on mouseover)
- Choose a testing plan.
- Idea: fill in the blank (cover up something in a picture, user says what it is)
- Orthographics: given a compound word like ????, user says whether a proposed spelling like ??? is correct. Or given an Ungglish word along with English spelling and pronounciation (if different), you have to pick the Ungglish word.
- Syllables: several syllables are offered for a picture. Construct words by clicking the right syllables, or construct sentences by clicking the right words.
- Game: Word cookies
- Comics, conversations, stories with hands-free mode
- Minimal pairs: e.g. check student ability to distinguish gus clas/glas, cuud/good, back/bag, sum/sun, etc.
- Pimsleur method:
  - Algorithm could choose random words and sentences from previous lessons 
    to repeat based on time since a word was last used. If slow or incorrect 
    response, user needs to see a word again soon. But how soon???
  - Begin and end each lesson with words from previous lessons.
- Teaching principles:
  - Avoid ambiguity in pictures.
  - Show boundaries of meanings by showing things that are and are not each new noun/verb/adj. This is less practical in early lessons though and those early nouns and verbs should be revisited later when the student knows more words.
- Early input box helpers (HTML): spell check, suggestions given word from english (status bar: no automatic replacement for learners), highlight verbs, adverbs, prepositions and letter pairs with special pronunciations
- Get feedback from students when we get students.

- Design review: verb can have different meaning from noun/adj/adv. Review how much troule is caused with affix system.
- Examples: set/seta, rieta/riet, turna/turn?, meena/meen, seeda/seed, noet/noeta, wind/winda, raes/raesa
- Spelling review: could we define 'e' as making an 'uh' sound following the stressed syllable?
