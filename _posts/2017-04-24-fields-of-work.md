Plan for Ungglish
-----------------

- Use "-ics", "-ic", "-icist" for fields of practice, of math, or of philosophy. "-ics" can also refer to emergent behavior (physics, politics, dynamics).
  - By keeping the "-ic" suffix rather than "-icul" or "-icl", we favor simplicity against the need to resemble English. It's not clear whether this is the best decision, but it's easy to remember since -ic is the normal adjectival ending. Perhaps -icul or -icl should be allowed interchangably with -ic.
  - Examples: ethics/ethic/ethicist, politics/politic/politicist, statistics/statistic/statisticist, kemics/kemic/kemicist, lojics/lojic/lojicist
- Use "-ology", "-ologic", "-ologist" for fields of scientific study.
  - For physics, introduce "phyzology", "phyzological", "phyzologist". "phyzics" is a valid word,
    but it refers to objects behavior or simulations of physics, not the science of physics.
  - Note: The Ungglish word "ology" means "field" and it can refer to fields that are named 
    "ics", not just fields named "ology".
  - Science fields corresponding to fields of practice can follow this pattern, e.g. 
    politology = political science, toothhology (or bietsterology) = dental science
  - "Ideology" is not a field of work or study, so I'm not sure what to do with it. Spell it 
    "idee.olujy" to separate it visually from "ologys"?
- That which is studied by a scientific field takes the suffix -y: syky = psyche, 
  eeco-y = ecosystem, s'cie'ty = society. I chose this suffix, of course, because it makes 
  a couple of "hits" with existing words. However, in general "y" is a bad suffix because 
  it is already used by so many words, both as part of the root (family, redy) and as part
  of a suffix (only, oen-dee = property). So for the "-ics" words I chose a new suffix 
  "im", which is similar to the existing suffix "um" for substances (as in heelium, lithhium, 
  calcium, carbum...). "im" is a very general suffix that means "tangible or intangible 
  thing". It marks a canonical "object" associated with a field, so lojim = logic, 
  sta.tistim = statistic, mathim = mathematical object, and theerim = theorem (because it 
  sounds too much like "theorem" to mean something else). Note that "logic" and "statistic" 
  are _adjectives_ in Ungglish so we need a new noun to take their English meaning.
- Popular roots in English like "phys", "polit", "eth", "kem" exist in Ungglish but cannot be 
  used by themselves because they are not assigned any part of speech.
  - "syk" is in the extended vocabulary; "miendology" is preferred over "sykology"
  - "med" is already an English word meaning "a medicine"; I'm planning to keep that while 
    introducing "medics" meaning "the practice of medicine", even though medicine-the-field is 
	much broader than medicine-the-curative-substance.
  - "mathemat" is in the extended vocabulary; "math" is preferred: mathics, mathicist
  - More generally, prefer to make field names from Unnglish roots instead of greek roots.
- "Science" (scieent) follows neither pattern but instead follows the regular -ic/-ly/-ist pattern: scieent, scieentic, scieently, scieentist
- "Ideology" is not a field; the root word is considered to be "idiolog" so we have "iediolog"
- For agriculture, the ideal series would be farmics/farmic/farmicist, but of course "farmicist" 
  sounds just like "pharmacist" so it doesn't work. Instead I've introduced the root "agri": 
  agrics/agric/agricist.
- For aquaculture, I suggest mar-farmics or mar-agrics, based on the Ungglish word mar which is 
  the Spanish word for sea. The latter suggestion is odd since "agr" originally meant "field", 
  but in English "agri" means farming, not fields (e.g. agri-business).
- Note that in English, some roots come in two versions with varying stress; for example "astronomy" 
  and "astronomical" appear to differ only in suffixes, but in fact the root word changes too, from 
  "as-trOn-om" in "astronomy" to "as-truh-nOm" in "astronomical". For Ungglish I have chosen only a 
  single version of each word root.

So the words in Ungglish are currently planned as follows:
